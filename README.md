# Shabd Saran

Welcome to my corner on the internet!

I am a Founding Member at an early-stage YC fintech startup, Swadesh, where I work as a Software Engineer. I have graduated recently, in 2021, from an undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering.

I like reading books, particularly non-fiction, though I cannot say I am an active reader having read only a limited number of books. Besides that, I have been following Football since my childhood and only recently started watching Formula 1.
