# Shabd Saran

Welcome to my corner on the internet!

I work as a Software Engineer at [smallcase](https://smallcase.com), which is a platform to invest in model portfolios of stocks, ETFs and REITs. Prior to that, I have worked at a bunch of tech companies ranging from a unicorn in India to an early-stage YC fintech startup.

Also, I volunteer at [iSPIRT](https://ispirt.in/) to build impactful products for the Indian masses. Currently, I am working on the Indian Software Product Registry (ISPR).

I like reading books, particularly non-fiction. Besides that, I have been following Football since my early childhood, and only recently started watching Formula 1.
